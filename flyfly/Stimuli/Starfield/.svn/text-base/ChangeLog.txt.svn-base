This version of Starfield has some small changes:

The parameter VIEWDISTANCE in starfieldUserSettings is how far away from the viewers
position objects exist. This value has the same unit has "distance to monitor" in
the settings.

VIEWDISTANCE, monitor width, distance to monitor and the screen resolution is used to 
calculate the box which the stars exist within. The size is such that a viewer sitting
in the center looking through the monitor is unable to see 4 of the 6 walls in the box.

The length of the boxes sides is reffered to as box_x, box_y and box_z. Stars moving in
the box will reappear on the other side if they hit any side.

All this together should hopefully ensure that no stars will dissapear unexpectedly 
from the monitor.
